            <h3>Autonomous Systems</h3>
            <p>From drones to loitering munitions ("sentient missiles"), AI enables systems to identify, track, and engage targets with decreasing levels of human intervention. This raises significant ethical and strategic questions about control and escalation.</p>

            <h3>Decision Dominance</h3>
            <p>Modern warfare is increasingly a battle of information processing. AI algorithms can analyze vast streams of sensor data to provide commanders with actionable intelligence faster than any human team, creating a state of "decision dominance."</p>

            <h3>The Algorithmic Arms Race</h3>
            <p>Nations are now engaged in an arms race not just for better hardware, but for superior algorithms. The development of adversarial AI, which seeks to fool or disable an opponent's AI systems, is a new and critical domain of electronic warfare.</p>
