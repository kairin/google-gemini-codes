        <h2>The Challenge: F5 Client Deep Dive</h2>
        <p>
            Successfully containerizing the F5 BIG-IP APM client requires a deep understanding of its specific characteristics and dependencies. The client is not a simple command-line tool, presenting several technical hurdles on modern Linux systems like Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Primary Hurdles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GUI-Dependent:</strong> Requires a graphical environment, as it's typically launched from a browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Legacy Libraries:</strong> Critically depends on <code>libxml2.so.2</code> and OpenSSL 1.x, which are absent in modern Ubuntu.</li>
            <li><strong>Bundled QT:</strong> F5 bundles its own QT libraries, which is helpful but requires careful handling of other system dependencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solution Architecture</h2>
        <p>The core architectural choice is how to provide a graphical user interface for the browser from within a headless Docker container. We strongly recommend the VNC/noVNC approach over X11 Forwarding due to its superior portability and security.</p>

        <h2>Step-by-Step Implementation</h2>
        
        <h3>Part 1: Dockerfile & Dependencies</h3>
        <p>The Dockerfile serves as the blueprint for your container. It begins with a robust base image, typically <code>ubuntu:24.04</code> LTS for its stability and modern package support. The crucial steps involve installing the F5 VPN client and addressing its unique legacy dependencies.</p>
        
        <h3>Part 2: GUI & Browser Setup</h3>
        <p>To provide a graphical interface, a virtual display and VNC server are installed, along with your chosen web browsers. It's recommended to install Firefox from the Mozilla Team PPA to avoid snap-related issues in Docker.</p>

        <h3>Part 3: VPN Automation with <code>f5fpc</code> CLI</h3>
        <p>Automating the VPN connection reliably is best achieved using the F5 command-line client, <code>f5fpc</code>, rather than relying on browser GUI automation. Use environment variables or Docker secrets to handle credentials securely.</p>
        
        <h3>Part 4: Docker Networking</h3>
        <p>Correct network configuration is vital. The container must be run with <code>--cap-add=NET_ADMIN</code> to modify routing tables. A common issue is IP address conflicts between Docker's default network and your corporate VPN's IP range. Using <code>--net=host</code> is a simple fix, but modifying Docker's default bridge network (`bip`) is more secure.</p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Issue: <code>libxml2.so.2</code> not found.</strong><br>Resolution: This is expected on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04. You must manually install a compatible version or create a symlink in your Dockerfile.</li>
            <li><strong>Issue: VPN connection reset errors / No intranet access.</strong><br>Resolution: This is almost always an IP address conflict. Use <code>--net=host</code> or change Docker's default IP range.</li>
        </ul>
