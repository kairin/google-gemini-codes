// This component acts as the bridge for your second React app.

// 1. Import the main component from your new Quasicrystals application.
import QuasicrystalsApp from '../scripts/quasicrystals/App.tsx';

<!--
2. Render the React component.
   The "client:visible" directive is slightly different. It tells Astro:
   - "client:": This component needs JavaScript to run in the user's browser.
   - ":visible": Wait to load this component's JavaScript until the user scrolls down and it becomes visible in the viewport. This improves initial page load performance.

<QuasicrystalsApp client:visible />
