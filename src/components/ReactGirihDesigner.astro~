// This component acts as the bridge between your static Astro site and your interactive React app.

// 1. Import the main component from your React application.
//    Astro understands how to process this import thanks to the @astrojs/react integration.
import GirihApp from '../../scripts/react-girih-tile-designer/App.tsx';

<!--
2. Render the React component here.
   The "client:load" directive is the most important part. It tells Astro:
   - "client:": This component needs JavaScript to run in the user's browser.
   - ":load": Load this component's JavaScript as soon as the page loads.
-->
<GirihApp client:load />
