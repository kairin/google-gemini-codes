      // Get the current path, including the repository name (base path).
      const repoPath = '/google-gemini-codes';
      const path = window.location.pathname.startsWith(repoPath) 
        ? window.location.pathname.substring(repoPath.length) 
        : '/';
      
      // Store the path to be redirected to after the main script loads.
      sessionStorage.redirect = path;

      // Redirect to the home page. The home page's script will handle the rest.
      window.location.href = repoPath + '/';
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>If you are not redirected automatically, <a href="/google-gemini-codes/">click here</a>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```We can add a script to the homepage later to handle the redirect, but this is a solid start.

### Your Final Action Plan

1.  **Confirm `deploy.yml`:** Ensure it contains the official Astro workflow you provided.
2.  **Update `astro.config.mjs`:** Use the full version with both `site` and `base` defined.
3.  **(Recommended) Create `src/components/BaseLink.astro`:** and update your other components to use it for internal links.
4.  **Create `public/404.html`:** Add the fallback file.
5.  **Commit and Push:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: implement official Astro deployment workflow and config"
    git push origin main
    ```

This aligns with all best practices and should result in a perfectly working site, both locally and on GitHub Pages.
